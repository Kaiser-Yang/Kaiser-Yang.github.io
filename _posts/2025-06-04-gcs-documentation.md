`gcs` stands for Git Center Server.
It is a Git repository management system
that provides a web interface for managing Git repositories, similar to GitHub or GitLab.
This project is developed by the [CMIPT](https://github.com/CMIPT).
We do this mainly to provide a self-hosted solution for our team, and practice our skills in coding.
`gcs` is still in the early stages of development,
and there are many features that are not yet implemented.
Therefore, we hope that there will be more contributors to join the project.
Do not be afraid to contribute, even if you are not familiar with it,
there will be someone to help you.
