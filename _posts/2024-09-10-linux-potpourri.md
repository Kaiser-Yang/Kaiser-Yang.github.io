**This post is being continuously updated.**

## Shell

**NOTE**: All the contents are based on `bash` shell.

### Shortcuts

* `Ctrl + A`: Move to the beginning of the line.
* `Ctrl + E`: Move to the end of the line.
* `Ctrl + U`: Delete from the cursor to the beginning of the line.
* `Ctrl + K`: Delete from the cursor to the end of the line.
* `Ctrl + W`: Delete the word before the cursor.
* `Ctrl + L`: Clear the screen.
* `Ctrl + Z`: Send SIGTSTP to the foreground process (suspend).
* `Ctrl + C`: Send SIGINT to the foreground process (terminate).
* `Ctrl + \`: Send SIGQUIT to the foreground process (terminate and create core dump).
* `Ctrl + D`: Send EOF to the foreground process (end of file).

### Wildcards

Wildcards are symbols that can be used to match multiple files or directories.
Those symbols are supported by the shell, and they can be used in any command
as long as the shell supports them.

Different shells may have different wildcard symbols,
there are some wildcards in the `bash` shell:

* `*`: matches any number of characters (including 0).
* `?`: matches a single character (excluding `/`).
* `[]`ï¼šmatches any character in the brackets. For example, `[abc]` matches `a` or `b` or `c`.
* `[!]` or `[^]`: matches any character not in the brackets. For example, `[!abc]` matches any
character except `a`, `b` and `c`.

In the square brackets, you can use `-` to represent a range, for example, `[0-9]`
matches any digit, and `[a-z]` matches any lowercase letter.

There is a symbol `{}` which is not a wildcard but is often used in the same way.
It is used to represent multiple strings, for example, `a{b,c}d` will be parsed as `abd` or `acd`.
For example, `mv file_{old,new}` will be parsed as `mv file_old file_new`. You can use
nested curly brackets, for example, `echo a{b{c,d},e}f` will be parsed as `echo abcf abdf aef`,
which works like distributive law in mathematics. `..` is used to represent a range,
for example, `echo {a..z}` will be parsed as `echo a b c ... z`.

**Note**: these wildcards are not all same with regex. In regex, `*` means 0 or more times,
`?` means 0 or 1 time, and `^` also means the beginning of a line.

When `extglob` is on (use `shopt | grep extglob` to check), those below are supported:

* `?(pattern-list)`: Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns.
* `*(pattern-list)`: Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns.
* `+(pattern-list)`: Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns.
* `@(pattern-list)`: Matches one of the given patterns.
* `!(pattern-list)`: Matches anything except one of the given patterns.

### Quoting

Quoting is to cancel the special meaning of some characters in the shell.
For example,
`|`, `&`, `;`, `(`, `)`, `<`, `>`, space, tab, newline and `!` are special characters in the shell.
You must quote them if you want to use them as normal characters.

#### Escape Character

`\` is the escape character in the shell. It can be used to cancel the special meaning of
the next character.

It is worth noting that if the next character is a newline, the newline will be treated
as a line continuation. We use this to avoid writing long commands in one line.

#### Single Quotes

Characters in enclosing single quotes are preserved literally.

**NOTE**: You can not put a single quote between enclosing single quotes
even if preceded by a backslash.
You can put a double quote between enclosing single quotes directly.

#### Double Quotes

Characters in enclosing double quotes are preserved literally,
except for `$`, `` ` ``, `\`, and `!` (when history expansion is enabled).

**NOTE**: When the shell is in POSIX mode, the `!` has no special meaning within  double  quotes,
even when  history  expansion  is  enabled.

`$` and `\`` retain their special meaning within double quotes. For example:

```bash
# $variable will be replaced by the value of the variable
echo "Hello, $USER" # Hello, kaiser
# `command` will be replaced by the output of the command
echo "Today is `date +%A`" # Today is Monday
# \ will be preserved literally unless followed by $ or ` or " or \ or newline
echo "Hello, \$USER" # Hello, $USER
echo "Hello, \"" # Hello, "
echo "Hello, \ no used" # Hello, \ no used
echo "Heloo, \
World" # Hello, World
```

When history expansion is enabled, `!` will be interpreted as a history expansion character:

```bash
ls
# !!: the last command
echo "!!" # ls
```

You can use `$"string"` to translate the string according to the current locale.
If there is no translation available, the string `$` will be ignored.

### Variables

You can use `name=[value]` (square braces here mean that the `value` is optional) to define a
variable and set its value. If the `value` is omitted, the empty string is assigned to it.

**NOTE**: You can not put a space between `name` and `=`. For example, `name = value` is invalid.

You can also use `declare` command to define a variable and set its value.
Those below are available `declare` attributes options:

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `-a` | indexed array |
| `-A` | associative array |
| `-i` | integer |
| `-l` | lowercase value automatically |
| `-u` | uppercase value automatically |
| `-r` | readonly |
| `-x` | export |
| `-n` | name reference to another variable |
| `-t` | trace, rarely used |

**NOTE**: You can use `+` instead of `-` to unset an attribute.

If you use `declare -i` to set the integer attribute of a variable, the value will be evaluated
as an arithmetic expression automatically, for example:

```bash
a=1+2
echo $a # 1+2
# You can use $((...)) to evaluate an arithmetic expression
echo $((a)) # 3
declare -i a=1+2
echo $a # 3
```

You can use `+=` to expand a variable:

```bash
declare -i num=5
num+=3
echo $num # 8
num+=2+5
echo $num # 15

str="Hello"
str+=" World"
echo "$str" # Hello World

arr=("apple" "banana")
arr+=("cherry" "date")
echo "${arr[@]}" # apple banana cherry date

arr=([0]="a" [2]="b") # Non-continuous index
arr+=("c") # Appends at index 3 (next max index + 1)
echo "${!arr[@]}" # 0 2 3 (indexes of the array)

# Must use declare -A aarr to define aarr as an associative array,
# which is similar with a dictionary or map
declare -A aarr
aarr=([name]="Alice" [age]=30)
aarr+=([city]="Paris" [job]="Engineer") # Add new keys
echo "${aarr[@]}" # Alice 30 Paris Engineer (unordered)
```

The `*` in the value of a variable is not expanded, but is treated as a normal character.
You can use `(*.txt)` to expand to all `.txt` files.

**NOTE**: The variable can be unset by the `unset` command.

### Positional Parameters

A positional parameter is a parameter denoted by one or more digits,
other than the single digit 0.

Positional parameters are assigned from the shell's arguments when it is invoked,
and may be reassigned using the `set` builtin command.
Positional parameters may not be assigned to with assignment statements.
The positional parameters are temporarily replaced when a shell function is executed.

When a positional parameter consisting of more than a single digit is expanded,
it must be enclosed in braces.

You can update positional parameters with `set` command, for example:

```bash
# Set all the positional parameters with 1 2 3 4
set -- 1 2 3 4

args=("$@") # Copy positional args into an array
args[1]="mango" # Change the second element (index 1)
set -- "${args[@]}" # Reset positional arguments

set -- "$@" "bird" # Append "bird"

set -- "fish" "$@" # Prepend "fish"

# Remove the first positional parameter
# After this, the $1 is the value of original $2
shift # or shift 1

args=("$@")
unset 'args[2]' # Remove the second positional parameter
set -- "${args[@]}"
```

**NOTE**: `0` is not a positional parameter, it is a special parameter, which will be expanded to
the name of the shell or shell script.

### Special Parameters

* `$*`: All positional parameters, each of which expands to a separate word.
* `"$*"`: A single string with all positional parameters
separated by the first character of the `IFS` variable.
If `IFS` is unset, the parameters are separated by spaces.
If `IFS` is null, the parameters are joined without intervening separators.
* `$@`: All positional parameters, each of which expands to a separate word.
* `"$@"`: Equivalent to `"$1" "$2" ... "$N"` (where N is the number of positional parameters).
`prefix"$@"suffix` will be parsed as `prefix"$1" "$2" ... "$N"suffix`.
* `$#`: The number of positional parameters in decimal.
* `$?`: The exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
* `$$`: The process ID of the shell. In a sub-shell,
it expands to the process ID of the current shell, not the sub-shell.
* `$!`: The process ID of the job most recently placed into the background.
* `$0`: The name of the shell or shell script.
If bash is invoked with a file of commands, `$0` is set to the name of that file.
If bash is started with the `-c` option,
then `$0` is set to the first argument after the string to be executed, if one is present.
Otherwise, it is set to the filename used to invoke bash, as given by argument zero.
* `$_`: The last argument of the previous command or script path.
* `$-`: The current option flags as specified upon invocation,
by the set builtin command, or those set by the shell itself (such as the -i option).

The characters of `$-` and their meanings:

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `h` | hashall (remembers command locations in `$PATH`) |
| `i` | interactive shell |
| `m` | monitor mode (job control enabled) |
| `H` | history expansion enabled (e.g., `!!` expands to the last command) |
| `B` | brace expansion enabled (e.g., `{a, b}` expands to `a b`) |
| `s` | compounds read from stdin (e.g., `bash -s` |

### Arrays

An indexed array is created automatically
if any variable is assigned to using the syntax `name[subscript]=value`.
The subscript is treated as an arithmetic expression that must evaluate to a number.

For an indexed array, you can use negative index, which will count back from the end of the array.
For example, `a[-1]` means the last element, and `a[-2]` means the second to last.

You can reference an element of any array with `${name[subscript]}`.
You can not omit the braces.

You can use `${name[@]}` or `${name[*]}` to get all assigned values,
and `${!name[@]}` or `${!name[@]}` to get all assigned indices.
They difference between them when they are double-quoted
is similar with the one between `"$@"` and `"$*"`.

`${#name[subscript]}` expands to the length of `${name[subscript]}`.
If subscript is `*` or `@`, the expansion is the number of elements in the array.

`$name` is equivalent to `${name[0]}`.

`unset name[0]` can destroy the first element of the array.

`unset name` or `unset name[@]` or `unset name[*]` will removes the entire array.

You can use `declare -a name` to create an array called `name`.

You can use `declare -A name` to create an associative array called `name`.

`declare -a -A name` is equivalent to `declare -A name`.

For an associative array,
Using `name=( key1 value1 key2 value2...)` and `name=( [key1]=value1 [key2]=value2 ...)`
to assign value are both OK. But you can not mixed these two types like
`myarr=( key1 value1 [key2]=value2 )`.
If you leave off a value at the end, it's treated as the empty string.
In `declare -A myarr=( key1 value1 key2 )`, `myarr[key2]` is an empty string.

When using a variable name with a subscript as an argument to a command,
such as with unset (`unset arr[i]`),
without using the word expansion syntax described above (`unset ${arr[i]}`),
the argument is subject to pathname expansion (expands to `unset arri`).
If pathname expansion is not desired, the argument should be quoted
(`unset 'arr[i]'` or `unset "arr[i]"`).

### Expansion

The order of expansions is:

* brace expansion;
* tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion,
arithmetic expansion, command substitution (done in a left-to-right fashion)
and process substitution (if the system supports it);
* word splitting;
* pathname expansion.

After these expansions are performed,
quote characters present in the original word are removed
unless they have been quoted themselves (quote removal).

#### Brace Expansion

This is the expansion of `{}` see [Wildcards](#wildcards).

#### Tilde Expansion

* `~`: Current user's home (`$HOME`).
* `~username`: Home directory of `username`.
* `~+`: Current working directory (`$PWD`).
* `~-`: Previous working directory (`$OLDPWD`).
* `"~"` or `'~'`: Literal `~` (no expansion).
* `~+number`: The `number`-th entry of the output `dirs` (0-indexed).
* `~-number`: The `number`-last entry of the output `dirs` (1-indexed).
* `~number`: Same as `~+number`.

**NOTE:** You can use `pushd` to add directory to `dirs` and `popd` to remove directory from `dirs`.

#### Parameter and Variable Expansion

* `${parameter}`: The value of parameter is substituted. Sometimes, the braces can be omitted.
* `${!parameter}`: Expands to the value of the variable named by `parameter`.
* `${!nameref}`: Expands to the referenced name, for example:

```bash
declare -n nameref_var="target_var"  # nameref_var is a reference to target_var
target_var="Hello"

echo "$nameref_var" # Hello (dereferences automatically)
echo "${!nameref_var}" # target_var (returns the referenced name)
```

* `${!prefix*}` or `${prefix@}`: Expands to the values of variables whose names begin with `prefix`.
For example:

```bash
a=1
aa=11
aaa=111
echo "${!a*}" # 1 11 111 (all variables starting with a)
echo "${!a@}" # 1 11 111 (all variables starting with a)
```

* `${parameter:offset}`: Expands to the substring of the value of `parameter`
starting at the character specified by `offset`.
* `${parameter:offset:length}`: Expands to the substring of the value of `parameter`
starting at the character specified by `offset` and extending for `length` characters.
For examples:

```bash
# Basic usage
str="Hello, World!"
echo "${str:7}" # World! (substring starting at index 7)
echo "${str:7:5}" # World (substring starting at index 7 and length 5)
echo "${str:7:-1}" # World (substring starting at index 7 and end at -1)
# The space between `:` and `-` is required to avoid confusion with the `:-` expansion
echo "${str: -6}" # World! (substring starting at index -6)
echo "${str: -6:5}" # World (substring starting at index -6 and length 5)
echo "${str: -6:-1}" # World (substring starting at index -6 and end at -1)

# For @
set -- A B C D E
echo "${@:0:1}" # the name of the script or the shell
echo "${@:2}" # B C D E (substring starting at index 2)
echo "${@:2:3}" # B C D (substring starting at index 2 and length 3)
echo "${@: -3}" # C D E (substring starting at index -3)
echo "${@: -3:2}" # C D (substring starting at index -3 and length 2)
# echo "${@:2:-1}" # Error, the length can not be negative for @

# For indexed array
arr=(A B C D E)
echo "${arr[@]:2}" # C D E (substring starting at index 2)
echo "${arr[@]:2:3}" # C D E (substring starting at index 2 and length 3)
echo "${arr[@]: -3}" # C D E (substring starting at index -3)
echo "${arr[@]: -3:2}" # C D (substring starting at index -3 and length 2)
# echo "${arr[@]:2:-1}" # Error, the length can not be negative for an indexed array

# Undefined results for associative array
```

* `${!array[@]}` or `${!array[*]}`: Expands to the indices of the array `array`.
* `${#parameter}`: The length of the value of `parameter` is substituted.
* `${#*}` or `${#@}`: Same with `$#`: the number of positional parameters.

For those below, you can remove `:` to make it only work for unset variables:

* `${parameter:-word}`: Expands to `word` if `parameter` is unset or null;
otherwise, it expands to the value of `parameter`.
* `${parameter:=word}`: Assigns `word` to `parameter` and expands to `word`
if `parameter` is unset or null;
otherwise, it expands to the value of `parameter`.
You can not use this to positional parameters.
* `${parameter:?word}`: `word` is written to standard error if `parameter` is unset or null,
if it is not interactive, exits;
otherwise, it expands to the value of `parameter`.
* `${parameter:+word}`: Nothing is substituted if `parameter` is null or unset;
otherwise, the expansion of `word` is substituted.

For those below,
if `parameter` is `@` or `*` or an array subscripted with `@` or `*`,
the pattern removal operation is applied to each element in turn,
and the expansion is the resultant list:

* `${parameter#word}`: Removes the shortest match of `word` from the beginning of `parameter`.
Wildcards are allowed in `word`. See [Wildcards](#wildcards).
* `${parameter##word}`: Removes the longest match of `word` from the beginning of `parameter`.
Wildcards are allowed in `word`. See [Wildcards](#wildcards).
* `${parameter%word}`: Similar to `${parameter#word}`
but removes the suffix instead of the prefix.
* `${parameter%%word}`: Similar to `${parameter##word}`
but removes the suffix instead of the prefix.
* `${parameter@U}`: Converts the value of `parameter` to uppercase.
* `${parameter@u}`: Converts the first character of the value of `parameter` to uppercase.
* `${parameter@L}`: Converts the value of `parameter` to lowercase.
* `${parameter@a}`: Expands to the attributes of `parameter`.
* `${parameter@E}`: Expands to a string with all the escaped characters expanded
(such as `\n` -> newline).
* `${parameter@A}`: Expands to a string whose value,
if evaluated,
will recreate `parameter` with its attributes and value.
If used for array variables, you should use `${a[@]@A}` to get the string.
* `${parameter@Q}`: Expands to a single-Quoted string with any special characters
(such as `\n`, `\t`, etc.) escaped.
* `${parameter@K}`: Similar to `${parameter@Q}`, but this will
print the values of indexed and associative arrays as a sequence of quoted key-value pairs.
* `${parameter@P}`: Expands as if it were a prompt string.
For examples:

```bash
PS1='\u@\h:\w\$ '
echo "${PS1@P}" # user@host:/path$  (expands prompt codes)

a='Hello World'
b=('Hello' 'World')
declare -A c=([first]='Hello' [second]='World')
echo "${a@P}" # Hello World
echo "${b[@]@P}" # Hello World
echo "${c[@]@P}" # World Hello (unordered)
echo "${a@K}" # 'Hello World'
echo "${b[@]@K}" # 0 "Hello" 1 "World"
echo "${c[@]@K}" # first "Hello" second "World"
```

* `${parameter/pattern/string}`: Replace the longest match of `pattern` with `string`.
If `pattern` begins with `/`, all matches of `pattern` are replaced with `string`.
If `pattern` begins with `#`, it must match at the beginning of the expanded value of `parameter`.
If `pattern` begins with `%`, it must match at the end of the expanded value of `parameter`.
If `string` is null,
matches of `pattern` are deleted and the `/` following `pattern` may be omitted.
If the `nocasematch` shell option is enabled,
the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters.
* `${paramter^pattern}`: Convert the first match of `pattern` to uppercase.
The `pattern` can only match one character.
If `pattern` is omitted, it is treated like a `?`, which matches every character.
Wildcards are allowed in `pattern`.
See [Wildcards](#wildcards).
* `${paramter^^pattern}`: Convert all matches of `pattern` to uppercase.
The `pattern` can only match one character.
If `pattern` is omitted, it is treated like a `?`, which matches every character.
Wildcards are allowed in `pattern`.
See [Wildcards](#wildcards).
* `${paramter,pattern}`: Convert the first match of `pattern` to lowercase.
The `pattern` can only match one character.
If `pattern` is omitted, it is treated like a `?`, which matches every character.
Wildcards are allowed in `pattern`.
See [Wildcards](#wildcards).
* `${paramter,,pattern}`: Convert all matches of `pattern` to lowercase.
The `pattern` can only match one character.
If `pattern` is omitted, it is treated like a `?`, which matches every character.
Wildcards are allowed in `pattern`.
See [Wildcards](#wildcards).

#### Arithmetic Expansion

* `$$(expression)`: The value of `expression` is substituted.

#### Command Substitution

* `$(command)` or `` `command` ``: The standard output of `command` is substituted
with trailing newlines deleted.

#### Process Substitution

* `<(command)`: Provides the output of `command` as a file that can be read from.
* `>(command)`: Provides a file that, when written to, becomes the input for `command`

#### Word Splitting

The part depends on the `IFS` variable.

The shell scans the results of parameter expansion, command substitution,
and arithmetic expansion that did not occur within double quotes for word splitting.

You can put variables in double quotes to prevent word splitting, for examples:

```bash
a='1 2   3'
echo $a # 1 2 3
echo "$a" # 1 2   3

set -- $a
echo $# # 3
set -- "$a"
echo $# # 1
```

The `IFS` default to `space`, `tab`, and `newline`.

#### Pathname Expansion

See [Wildcards](#wildcards).

#### Quote Removal

After the preceding expansions,
all unquoted occurrences of the characters `\`, `'`, and `"`
that did not result from one of the above expansions are removed.

## `git`

### `.gitignore`

You can use `.gitignore` to specify files or directories that do not need to be tracked by `git`.

Most wildcards in `.gitignore` are similar to those in `bash`.
Check [Wildcards in Linux](#wildcards-in-linux) for more information about `wildcards`.

By default, the items in `.gitignore` will be ignored recursively.
If you don't want to ignore recursively, you can add `/` before the item to indicate
that it only takes effect in the current directory.
For example, `/foo` means to ignore only the `foo` file or directory in the current directory,
while `foo` means to ignore all `foo` files or directories.

By default, the items in `.gitignore` match both directories and files.
If you only want to match directories,
you can add `/` at the end of the item to indicate that it only matches directories.
For example, `foo/` means to match only the directory `foo`,
while `foo` means to match all `foo` files or directories.

You can configure the ignore rules in `~/.config/git/ignore` to ignore files globally.

There can be a `.gitignore` file in any directory in a repository,
and this file will take effect on files and directories in the current directory.
The priority of `.gitignore` files is from subdirectory to parent directory,
and the global ignore file has the lowest priority.
