## The importance of Version Control

<details>
    <summary>The answer from copilot</summary>
    <p>
        Version control is important
        because it helps individuals and teams manage changes to code,
        documents, or other digital assets over time.
        Here are some key reasons why version control is essential:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Track Changes: It records every modification made to files,
            allowing you to see what was changed, when, and by whom.
        </li>
        <li>
            Collaboration: Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously
            without overwriting each other's work.
            Version control systems help merge changes from different contributors.
        </li>
        <li>
            Revert Changes: If a mistake is made,
            you can easily revert files or entire projects back to a previous state.
        </li>
        <li>
            Branching and Experimentation: You can create branches to try out new features or ideas
            without affecting the main codebase. If the experiment fails, simply discard the branch.
        </li>
        <li>
            Accountability: With a detailed history of changes,
            it's easier to understand the reasoning behind specific updates
            and hold contributors accountable.
        </li>
        <li>
            Backup: Version control acts as a backup system,
            protecting against data loss in case of accidental deletions or hardware failures.
        </li>
        <li>
            Release Management: It helps in managing releases,
            hotfixes, and updates by tagging and keeping track of different versions of the project.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In summary: Version control provides a structured and reliable way to manage projects,
        improve collaboration, and safeguard your work.
        Itâ€™s a fundamental tool in modern software development and many other digital workflows.

## `.gitignore`

You can use `.gitignore` to specify files or directories that do not need to be tracked by `git`.

Most wildcards in `.gitignore` are similar to those in `bash`.
Check [Wildcards in Linux](#wildcards-in-linux) for more information about `wildcards`.

By default, the items in `.gitignore` will be ignored recursively.
If you don't want to ignore recursively, you can add `/` before the item to indicate
that it only takes effect in the current directory.
For example, `/foo` means to ignore only the `foo` file or directory in the current directory,
while `foo` means to ignore all `foo` files or directories.

By default, the items in `.gitignore` match both directories and files.
If you only want to match directories,
you can add `/` at the end of the item to indicate that it only matches directories.
For example, `foo/` means to match only the directory `foo`,
while `foo` means to match all `foo` files or directories.

You can configure the ignore rules in `~/.config/git/ignore` to ignore files globally.

There can be a `.gitignore` file in any directory in a repository,
and this file will take effect on files and directories in the current directory.
The priority of `.gitignore` files is from subdirectory to parent directory,
and the global ignore file has the lowest priority.
